  |   When Quinn wakes up alone in a locked room with nothing of note       |
  |   save for a computer hooked up to an internet chat room in which       |
  |   you're present, you become his single ray of hope. Your choices -     |
  |   and your timeliness - will single-handedly shape his escape           |
  |   efforts... or lead him down the path to an untimely end.              |
  |                                                                         |

  |   STAY plays out in real-time, meaning that every minute spent away     |
  |   from the game is a minute Quinn is left alone. Drop out of            |
  |   conversations or leave Quinn to fend for himself for too long and     |
  |   there may be consequences.                                            |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Quinn is on edge, and so every response matters. Prove yourself a     |
  |   compassionate ally and he'll learn to trust you and share his         |
  |   findings and deepest thoughts. Fail, and his emotions may work        |
  |   against you.                                                          |
